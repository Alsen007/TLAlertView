TLAlertView
===========

A simple replacement for 1-button `UIAlertView` that uses UIKit Dynamics on iOS 7. See [this tutorial](http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/introduction-to-uikit-dynamics/) for more info.

This is *not* a robust `UIAlertView` replacement. Its only purpose is to demonstrate how to use UIKit Dynamics animations.
